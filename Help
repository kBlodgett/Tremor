The best way \nto have the correct format for the location \nand name is to navigate through your files \nfrom My Computer and clicking on your \nharddrive. From there navigate to your file \nand then copy the address bar.\nIt should look something like this:\n     C:\\Users\\My Guest\\Desktop\nThen at the end of the location append the \nname and csv to the end. \nIt should look something like this:\n     C:\\Users\\My Guest\\Desktop\\filename.csv\n\nFormat:\nThe format is the type of layout of the file. \nEnter only the numbers 1-4 into this textfield\nor the program will error/terminate.\nThe format choices are as follows:\n1 - The data is in minute increments.\n2 - The data is in second increments.\n3 - Alternate choice for minute increments. \n    Use this format if entering 1 for the file\n    makes the program crash.\n4 - Alternate choice for second inrements. \n    Use this format if entering 2 for the file\n    makes the program crash.\n\nBE PATIENT (Phantom Freeze)\nThe program takes some time to read the file. \nAfter closing the window that prompts you \nabout the loading time the threshold window \nwill pop up within a few minutes. If it takes \nlonger than a few minutes exit the program and \ntry again. If the program continues to do \nthis, try the alternate option of the type of \nincrements the file is. \nFor example if the number you entered for \nformat was 1 (file is in minute increments)\nthen the alternate format would be 3.\n\n------ENTERING IN THRESHOLDS------\nThe starting heart rate threshold must be \nHIGHER than the ending heart rate tremor.\nDefault thresholds are 120, 100, 5000. \n\n------VIEW OPTIONS - FILE------\nThis is the option to view the raw file that \nwas read in. It gives every min/sec from the \ndevice. There is also a save function on this \nwindow, Please refer to SAVE section.\n\n------VIEW OPTIONS - EVENTS------\nThis is the option to view all tremor events.\nIt gives you information about what is happen\nduring each tremor. There is also a save \nfunction on this window, Please refer to SAVE \nsection.\n\n------VIEW OPTIONS - DAILY EVENTS------\nThis is the option to view how many tremors \nhappened per day in the file and gives \nstatistics about each day.
